## Introduction

In an age where content is king, **Auto Shorts** provides a seamless solution for generating space-related videos using cutting-edge AI technology. With tools like Node.js, Remotion, and various APIs, you can automate the video creation process. 

This project fetches data from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) API, synthesizes audio using AWS Polly and AssemblyAI, and composes visually stunning videos. You can find the latest releases of the project [here](https://github.com/manju-27082003/auto-shorts/releases).

## Technologies Used

**Auto Shorts** integrates several technologies to deliver its functionality:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable applications.
- **Remotion**: A framework for creating videos programmatically using React.
- **Gemini API**: A service for retrieving space-related data.
- **AWS Polly**: Converts text to lifelike speech.
- **AssemblyAI**: Provides speech recognition and transcription services.
- **NASA APOD API**: Fetches the Astronomy Picture of the Day.

## Features

- **Automated Video Creation**: Generate videos daily without manual intervention.
- **AI-Powered Narration**: Use AWS Polly for natural-sounding voiceovers.
- **Dynamic Content**: Fetch daily space images and information from NASA's APOD API.
- **Seamless YouTube Integration**: Automatically publish videos to your YouTube channel.
- **Docker Support**: Run the application in a containerized environment.

## Installation

To get started with **Auto Shorts**, follow these steps:

   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys and configuration settings. Example:
   ```
   NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
   ```

4. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will automatically generate a new video each day. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Fetch Daily Data**: The application retrieves the Astronomy Picture of the Day from NASA's API.
2. **Generate Audio**: The description is converted into speech using AWS Polly.
3. **Create Video**: Remotion composes the video using the fetched image and audio.
4. **Publish to YouTube**: The video is uploaded to your YouTube channel.

You can customize various settings in the `.env` file to suit your needs.
